		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Sugarcane is a map generation framework and runtime environment for Minecraft. Its raison d'&#xEA;tre is
		primarily focussed on the generation of graphical maps of Minecraft worlds, but it could potentially be used for
		any kind of analysis/processing of world data.</p>
		<p>The major design goals for Sugarcane is that it must be <em>extensible</em>, and support efficient use of
		<em>distributed</em> computational resources.</p>
		<h3>Extensibility</h3>
		<p>All aspects of Sugarcane rely on a plugin system, allowing alternate implementations of various functionality
		to be swapped in and out at runtime, without having to rebuild Sugarcane itself. This makes it easy for third
		parties to extend Sugarcane's capabilities, and simple for end-users to make use of.</p>
		<h3>Distribution</h3>
		<p>Processing Minecraft worlds can frequently be computationally expensive, especially for large worlds. Thus,
		Sugarcane is designed to support not only vertical scaling, but also allow for horizontal scaling. It is
		important to note, however, that Sugarcane still fully supports a single-host configuration.</p>
